  "We're going to get rusticated before we graduate.  Hanszen Computer Committee.
  Fuck off." -- MT, around 2 in the morning.

  <center>Computer Committee Tasks</center>
</h1>
<p>
  So what does the computer committee do?  Well, in addition to running
  our Linux server Harry-Clay, we also maintain a network of Macintosh computers for
  the residents of the college and write web pages for Virtual Hanszen.
</p>

</h3>
<p>
  Harry-Clay.HanszeNet.Rice.Edu is our college web server.  It is a 120-MHz Pentium
  PC running Linux.  This machine gives college members a forum for creating mailing
  lists and web pages of interest to other college members, accounts with unlimited disk
  quotas, and constant email addresses for alumni as they leave Rice and
  get new accounts elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, in maintaining this machine, committee members get valuable experience in
  Unix system administration, including creation of accounts; filesystem diagnosis
  and maintenance; management of TCP/IP networking protocols and daemons; and
  configuration of Domain Name Server (DNS), Network Information Service (NIS),
  and HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) software.
</p>


<br>
<h3>Macintosh Network</h3>
<p>
  The Hanszen college computer lab (affectionately known as the weenie loft), in addition
  to being an Owlnet lab, contains a network of Macintosh computers.  These machines,
  maintained by the Hanszen College Computer Committee, provide college members with
  access to productivity software such as Word and Excel for working on term papers
  and reports.
</p>


<br>
<h3>Consulting</h3>
<p>
  In addition to maintaining computers owned by the college, the Computer Committee
  members help college residents to set up their network operating systems--including
  Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95, Windows NT, and MacOS--and answer questions
  about getting machines connected to the dorm Ethernet network.
</p>
<p>
  Also, Computer Committee members have frequently provided assistance on an ad-hoc
  basis to computer-oriented projects around the college and the university, including
  Student Association online officer voting, configuration of an email express
  terminal in the college coordinator's office, and the installation of air-conditioning
  in the weenie loft.
