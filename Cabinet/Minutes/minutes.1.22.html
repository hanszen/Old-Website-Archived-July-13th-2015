<font size=4><i>Everyone remembers getting their freshman book, during the summer before their freshman year. Your secretaries stumbled upon one from 1971 and one from 1978.  The statements on the left are actual quotes from these books.  If you hadn't figured it out, the statements on the right are how they might appear this year.</i></font>

		<li><font size=4></font>Included herein are both essential and nonessential items of information	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Eating lunch with an Associate helps in several ways.  Not only does the conversation broaden your education and stimulate your intellectual awareness, it also takes your mind off the food.	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Just keep the hell-raising reasonably quiet.	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>For those lucky enough to be chosen, Hanszen College exists as a paragon of emotional stability, athletic prowess, intellectual excellence, and extraneous B.S.	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>The well-known Hanszen color TV set (built in 1875 by fourteen Hanszen weanies) is located in the TV room next door.  Mr. Spock and the Wizard of Oz never had it so good.	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>On the fifth floor of the old tower is a new sundeck.  Here one can expose his semi-nude body to the rays of the Houston sun.	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Membership on the [rugby] team requires great physical stamina and mental incapacitation.	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>.Books, by the way will run you perhaps $100.	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Aggie: (n)  The missing link between ape and man.	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Wiess is a fine example of high Motel-6 architecture.	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Spring at Rice brings many things, foremost and most noticeable (besides the madness) the return of the birds.
	</ul>

		<td width=50% valign=top><font size=4>Now</font>	<ul>
		<li>Included herein are nonessential items of information.	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>A freight train crashing through the commons windows couldn't take your mind off the food, and eating lunch with an Associate may actually make you focus on the food.	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Fuck it.  You'll be so drunk you can't hear anything anyway.	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>For those lucky enough to be chosen, Hanszen College exists as a paragon of inebriated minors, hook-up crazy freshman, and intellectual apathy.  Oh yeah, don't forgot the extraneous B.S.	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>The well-known Hanszen color TV set is located in front of two plush couches that are so comfortable that even total tools could get some on them.  Ms. Haiges and the Wizard of Syphilis never had it so good.	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>On the fifth floor of the old tower is a new sundeck.  Here one can expose his or her semi-nude body to the gaping stares of sexually deprived Wiessmen, but you may have to get drunk first.	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Membership on the rugby team requires great mental incapacitation.  (See Munson, Jablecki or Fuentes)	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Books, by the way, can be obtained from Satan (see Campus Bookstore) in exchange for  your soul.	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Aggie: (n)  The missing link between ape and Dennis Huston	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Wiess is a fine example of high Motel-6 architecture.	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Spring at Rice brings many things, foremost and most noticeable the return of the insanely nymphomaniacal squirrels.
