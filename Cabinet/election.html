<br>
<p>
  <b><font size=+1>ARTICLE VI.  Voting Method</font></b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Section A.  Ballots</b><br>
     All voting shall be done by secret ballot.  The right of the absentee ballot 
     shall be preserved.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Section B.  Tallying</b><br>
  Votes shall be tallied using the following system:
  <ol>
    <li type="1">Each voter shall be asked to mark her choice of candidates on the ballot, 
      including a write-in candidate if she so chooses.
    <li type="1">In an election for one (1) office (the Officer Elections):
      <ol>
        <li type="a">The ballots cast for each candidate shall be counted.
        <li type="a">If one candidate has the majority of votes cast, she shall then be 		
          declared the winner.
        <li type="a">If no candidate has a majority, then a runoff will be declared between 	
          the two (2) candidates with the highest number of votes.  The candidate 	
          who garners a majority of votes in the runoff shall then be declared the 	
          winner.
        <li type="a">If two (2) candidates, for reason of a tie or discrepancy of ballots, 	
          cannot be identified for the runoff, all candidates affected by the tie or 	
          discrepancy shall be included in the runoff.  After the runoff, the candidate 
          with a plurality shall then be declared the winner.  For example, if the 	
          second (2nd) and third (3rd) place candidates are tied, the top three (3) 	
          candidates would be placed in the runoff. 
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li type="1">In an election for Section Representatives:
      <ol>
        <li type="a">Each voter shall have the opportunity to cast a number of votes equal to
          the number of positions available.

        <li type="a">The ballots cast for each candidate shall be counted.

        <li type="a">If any candidate has a majority of votes, she shall be declared the
          winner.

        <li type="a">If the number of candidates achieving a majority is less than the 	
          number of positions available, a runoff election will be held with the 	
          number of candidates equal to the number of available positions plus one 	
          (1).  Candidates with the highest number of votes among those who did 	
          not receive a majority in the first election will be declared candidates in 	
          the runoff.  The candidates who garner a plurality of votes in the runoff 	
          shall be declared the winners.

        <li type="a">If two (2) or more candidates, for reason of a tie or discrepancy of
          ballots, cannot be identified for the runoff, all candidates affected by the 	
          tie or discrepancy shall be included in the runoff.  The candidates with 	
          pluralities in the runoff shall then be declared the winners.  For example, if 
          in Section One, one (1) candidate receives a majority, but the third (3rd) 	
          and fourth (4th) place candidates are tied, than the second (2nd), third 	
          (3rd), and fourth (4th) place candidates would be placed in the runoff.
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<br>
<p>
  <b><font size=+1>ARTICLE VII.  Validation and Approval of Elections</font></b><br>
  <br>
  If no procedural errors justify invalidation of the election, the Judicial Committee 
  shall receive challenges to the election within three (3) days after results are 
  posted.  If a challenge is received, the Judicial Committee shall then meet to 
  approve or disapprove the election.  Ballots shall be saved until the election is 
  approved.  When the election is approved, the winners shall be declared.
</p>



<br>
<p>
  <b><font size=+1>ARTICLE VIII.  Turnover</font></b><br>

  <br>

    the election.
