    <ol>
      <li>The Masters are the highest ranking College members, responsible to the 
          University for the actions of the College.  Their duties are to be informed of and 
          to advise the College as a whole concerning all matters.  Although the University 
          has granted the Masters ultimate authority in the College, they should confine 
          their direct activity in the sphere of College government to only the most 
          extraordinary situations.  In the face of inaction or vacillation by the Cabinet on

          College policy.

          of Resident Associates.

      <li>In the event of the Masters’ disapproval of a Cabinet measure, the Cabinet 
          may, at its discretion, put the matter before the College as a whole in the form of
          a referendum.  The results of the referendum will be presented to the Masters for

<p>
  <b>Section C.  Non-resident Associates</b>
  <ol>
    <li>Non-resident Associates shall be invited by the Masters and the College to 
        further the aims of the College.  They shall upon invitation act in an advisory 
        capacity to the College.

    <li>The procedure for association shall be as follows:
      <ol>
        <li type=a>Alumni, University, and Community Associates may be suggested by 	
          any College member and formally nominated by the Associates 		
          Committee.  The Cabinet may then invite the nominee to serve as an 	
          Alumni, University or Community Associate for a term of two (2) years.  	
          Alumni Associates are alumni of Hanszen residing in the Houston area 	
          who wish to remain formally affiliated with the College.  University 	
          Associates are those Rice University staff members who can contribute to 	
          Hanszen in other than a faculty counselor role.  Community Associates are 
          those Houstonians whose formal relation with the College would be of 	
          general benefit.

        <li type=a>In the spring before their terms expire, all Alumni, University, and 	
          Community Associates who have, in the opinion of the Cabinet and at the 	
          recommendation of the Associates Committee, participated actively with 	
          Hanszen College will be invited to renew their association for another 	
          term.  There is no limit to the number of terms an Alumni, University, or 	
          Community Associate may serve.
