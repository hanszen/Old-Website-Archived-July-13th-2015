			<i>This document outlines Hanszen's situation in 1970, noting several areas that need improvement and hinting at future projects to improve the college.</i><br><br>
			<b><font size=+1>July 15, 1970</font></b><br>
			<b>Introduction</b><br>
			Right now Hanszen College is at a turning point. The new facilities and endowments combined with your own personal interest and our commitment can make membership in this college a more meaningful experience.<br><br>
			The imagination and the capacity for hard work are here. The Rice radio station, KTRU, began as a Hanszen project, Hanszen men built a coffeehouse which is still the only student-run entertainment on campus. We built our own photographic darkroom from scratch. Our community Associates program was the first student attempt at Rice to establish better relations with the Houston community, and Hanszen's magazine, the Tower, is the only attempt any college at Rice has ever made to keep its alumni informed.<br><br>
			For some things, though, hard work alone just won't get the job done. We can't "build" the money to redecorate the Commons and enthusiasm alone won't bring nationally prominent men to speak in our college. It takes money, and your help.<br><br>
			The college system began as an experiment. And as an experiment it must either grow or stagnate. The decision rests on our own determination to make Hanszen succeed.<br><br>
			<b>Library/Study Room</b><br>
			Hanszen maintains a small reference library and study room which are open even when Fondren Library is not. Hanszen's library is a quick source of information and the study room provides a quiet place to study 24 hours a day.<br><br>
			The library, however, needs new shelving and more current reference books; our only encyclopedia is a 1911 set of the Britanica. The study chairs in the study room badly need recovering and the mildewed carpet in both the library and study room should be replaced by more durable vinyl floor covering or all weather carpeting.<br><br>
			The acquisition of new books, maintenance and improvement must go on continuously. An endowment of at least $5,000 would make the services of the library and study room available to all future Hanszen members.<br><br>
			<b>Commons Renovation</b><br>
			The commons is just that, the common meeting area for the whole College. It includes the dining hall, a small alcove, and a large lounge. Ideally the lounge should be a meeting place where speakers talk informally after dinner, where test reviews for freshmen are held, where newspapers and magazines are read and where friends get together for conversation. The illustrated proposal would transform the lounge from a dark, high-ceilinged hallway with poor acoustics into a well-lighted room which could be used as it was intended.       The alcove should become a small meeting room, suitable for College courses or studying. The dining hall needs better lighting and acoustics so that it will be a better small auditorium for films, plays, and speakers, as well as a nicer place to eat.<br><br>
			The decorating firm of Evans-Monocle prepared the following proposal which is illustrated in the sketch (ommitted in on-line version).<br><br>
			<b>DAVID MASTERSON FUND</b><br>
	        Dr. William H. Masterson, the first Master of Hanszen College, and his wife Vetta established the David Masterson Fund in 1966 as a memorial to their first child who died in infancy.<br><br>
			Any principal or interest from the fund above $1,000 is to be spent by the student government with the approval of the Master. The endowment provides for permanent improvements and for the establishment or improvement of any educational facility or program.        Money donated to this fund would be used for projects like adding to the Hanszen library, making capital improvements to the Game and TV Rooms, coffeehouse, patio, lounge or Commons, or building new facilities such as exercise or music rooms.<br><br>
			<b>Patio</b><br>
			A patio located in the quadrangle would be a welcome addition to the College. The tree-shaded patio would be a gathering place on warm afternoons and an ideal location for small dances or parties and would be equipped with barbeque grills for weekend cookouts. Furthermore, it would cover an area which is now useless since it will not support grass and is a breeding-place for mosquitoes.<br><br>
			The following proposal and sketch (ommitted in on-line version) are submitted by Klatt and Porchner, landscape architects.<br><br>
			<b>Speaker Endowment</b><br>
			One of the most important functions of the College is to bring its members into contact with new and stimulating ideas and people.<br><br>
			Hanszen has always sponsored visits by noted scholars and men of ideas which are open to all Rice students. These men should be invited not just to speak to students but to talk with them, to have dinner in the Commons, to live in the College, so that we will have a chance to know them and to understand them and their ideas. But programs like this are expensive. Good speakers receive up to $2,500. At Yale and other schools, friends of the colleges have endowed speaker's chairs. The yearly interest brings prominent men to live in the colleges for several days and deliver a series of lectures and informal discussions. The annual income from a $50,000 endowment would permit Hanszen to invite one or two nationally prominent speakers, as well as several local figures, to exchange ideas with Rice students on a personal level.<br><br>
			<b>Financial Statement</b><br>
			All donations to Hanszen will be invested by Rice as part of the University's endowment. Funds will be used solely by Hanszen. As part of the University's endowment, each contribution is tax deductible.<br><br>
			To insure that all funds are spent properly, the Hanszen Cabinet on May 4, 1970, created the Hanszen Fund Drive Governing Committee, to be made up of the Master, the College President, a member of the alumni appointed by the Master, a student selected by the Cabinet, a student elected by the College, and the Fund Drive Chairman. This group will issue annual reports to all contributors and approve the disbursement of funds.<br><br>
			Of course, any donation is welcome and every effort will be made to insure that it is spent in accordance with the wishes of the donor, but unrestricted gifts can be put to use most rapidly.<br><br>
			Most of all, however, Hanszen College needs your continuing interest and involvement. Only with your help, both personal and financial, can Hanszen College continue to make an impact on the education of its members.<br><br>
			<b>Electronic Calculator</b><br>
			Most Science/Engineering students frequently need an electronic calculator to do their homework and laboratory reports when equipment is not available elsewhere on campus.<br><br>
			Although the University has some facilities which students may use on an unofficial basis, they are often busy and are not available during the evening when most people must do their homework. These machines calculate trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, roots, powers, summations and simplifies the arduous multiplication and division involved in many problems. A Wang or Hewlett-Packard calculator in Hanszen's study room would be available whenever it is needed. Such a machine costs from $4,000 to $5,500 and with yearly maintenance could continue to be or service to students for years to come.<br><br>
			<b>Continuing Involvement</b><br>
			Money can do a lot of things for Hanszen but it can't provide what this college needs most- and that's the talents and continuing interest of its alumni and friends.<br><br>
			Your interest is the only passports you need to become a part of the College. You are always welcome for lunch or dinner or any other time. And there are always things you can do to show your interest. There are Hasnzen College courses which could be taught in journalism or investment if we had someone to teach them, or we could offer our members graduate school or career counseling by people who know what they're talking about, or just after-dinner discussions about the latest developments in your field whether it's law, politics, or religion. All of these things would be educational in the best sense of the word because the teacher can learn as much as the student.<br><br>
			We've already invited a few interested Houstonians to become Community Associates. They show an interest in Hanszen so we invite them to all College events hoping that they will get as much out of them as we do. The Community Associates have also discussed their fields of interest, notably politics and urban problems.<br><br>
			So if you've got an interest in Hanszen College, there's a place for you. You'll enjoy meeting new people whose ideas and experiences may be different from yours, or maybe not as different as you think.<br><br>
			<b>Come to Hanszen, we'll both learn something.</b><br><br>
