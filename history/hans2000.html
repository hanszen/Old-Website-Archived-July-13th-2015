			<a name="introduction"><b>Introduction</b></a><br>
			Only twice in the history of Hanszen College has a group of its members gathered together to enumerate and discuss goals for Hanszen. In 1966 and in 1975 dedicated Hanszenites met to articulate some objectives regarding the future of their college.  These people considered not so much the current status of the college, or even the near future, but thought more in the long term, envisioning Hanszen for many years to come.  In a late night discussion this fall, two Hanszenites  Ross Goldberg and Mike Matlock decide that the time may have come again for such a meeting.
			With the upcoming Masters Search accompanied by an obvious period of transition in the college, they felt the need for a committee in which members of Hanszen college could again examine some future goals.  Hanszen 2000 was born, and committee members from each class were appointed by the president.  Two seniors, Mary Bittle Teer and Richie Ehlers, two juniors, Katrina Ramiller and Keri Baxter, three sophomores, Jackie Chu, Matt Lindley, and Selena Connealy, and three freshmen, Leslie Hanson, Maureen Reed, and Kara Kane, as well as S.A.. Senator Ron Chapman and Hanszen President Miller Rhodes served on the committee.<br><br>
			The committee began its task by talking with various members of the college about Hanszen, and while we learned quite a lot about the way people felt about their college we realized that this was not our function.  "We should not be glorified section reps, " as one member of the committee put it.  After reevaluating our goals somewhat, we decided that our committee should function as a "think tank." Compromising a fairly representative cross-section of the college, we felt we should meet and discuss crucial issues facing the college while trying to suggest alternatives or goals for the future at the same time.  From then on, we met on a weekly basis to discuss one or two of a series of important issues confronting the college.  Each week, one member of the committee volunteered to summarize the discussion of our meeting and subsequently present a report. We have combined the reports from each week to present to the new Hanszen cabinet at turnover.<br><br>
			The following represents the total work of the Hanszen 2000 committee. And while we did not always agree on the means to any solution, the fact that each member of this committee had the best interest of Hanszen college in mind was our point of consensus.  That is where we began, and we ended with suggestions as to how to begin to pursue these goals we feel are so important. While we focused on the long term, the committee also recognized certain improvements we can begin to make immediately. So we hope that the suggestions we make in this report will stir Hanszenites now and in the future to begin to do their part to make Hanszen what they want it to be. Good luck, and they can do it again in 2000!<br><br>
			<a name="roleofmasters"><b>The Role of the Master</b></a><br>
			The role of the master is crucial in securing the desired future identity of Hanszen College.  Based on prior experience with college/master relations, and long term expectations for the college, Hanszen 2000 made the following observations and recommendations regarding the role of the master.<br><br>
			The master's position should combine valuable assets of comradery and authority.  Comradery should exist to the extent that the master is visibly involved in college functions, particularly meals and sporting events, thereby demonstrating an interest in students' activities and a personal level of care. Direct interaction with students is an integral part of the master's role; an approachability and personability contribute to this valuable interaction.<br><br>
			At the same time, a presence of authority should exist in all interaction between the master and the college, not to the extent that the master assumes responsibility for the students, but so that an aura of dignity is preserved. While maintaining an open mind and willingness to listen to students' concerns, the master should be decisive in taking firm stands on college issues, and knowledgeable regarding methods of problem solving. Such a trait is strengthened by a demonstrated familiarity with the university and sincere commitment to Hanszen College.  Previous roles in the university and the college should be seriously considered when selecting a master.<br><br>
			The overwhelming trait of the master's role rests in the master's dedication to Hanszen College.  Such dedication exists on a private level, through recognition of the effect that such involvement will have on their family, research, and travel; on a person-to-person level, through visible demonstration of an individual care for each student's intellectual and social well being; and on an authoritative level, through decisive preservation of the college's integrity.<br><br>
			The members of Hanszen College exert a considerable influence toward the creation of such a role for the master.  First, in selecting the master, they must incorporate a comprehensive method, based on the concerns mentioned here, of determining these qualities in a potential master.  Secondly, they must work to make a person's transition into the role of a master an easy and welcoming one. Thirdly, they must work to demonstrate care, open-mindedness, and respect in all relations with the master.  Only a joint effort on the part of students and master will result in the fulfilling of what Hanszen 2000 sees as the role of the master.<br><br>
			<a name="roleofassoc"><b>The Role of the Associates</b></a><br>
			Associates serve as a valuable asset to Hanszen College, an asset which can clearly strengthen the ability of Hanszen College to ensure a successful future.  ON the basis of their duties and involvement, associates can be divided into two distinct groups: 1) faculty associates and 2) university and community associates.  Hanszen 2000 made the following observations based on experiences with and hopes for the associates' role in Hanszen College.<br><br>
			The primary aim of a faculty associate's involvement is academic.  First, an associate's ability to share knowledge with Hanszen College should be demonstrated, both through general measures such as lectures, and more personal efforts, such as a knowledgeable role in academic advising.  This academic capacity is strengthened by the other crucial fact of an associate's role: a genuine interest in the students of Hanszen College.  Such commitment is displayed through fulfillment of Orientation Week/Freshman Group responsibilities, and a willingness to be visibly involved in Hanszen College.<br><br>
			Community and university associates similarly work to strengthen the academic intentions of Hansen College. They should serve as resourceful contacts with the community, willing to contribute abilities that they see as valuable in addition to official duties and expectations.  Through lectures, appearances at college events, and personal involvement with students (especially Freshman Groups), community associates should demonstrate a commitment in accordance with their personal capacities.<br><br>
			Again, the realizations of such expectations depends on the students as well as the associates.  Through both the Associates Committee and individual efforts, Hanszen College must work to establish firm and friendly ties with its associates through communication regarding the official duties and expectations of the associate's role, and inclusion and personal invitation of associates to appropriate college events.  Efforts could also include a system of assigning individual students to serve as contacts for each associate, and a permanent display of Hanszen Associates' photographs in the Hanszen Commons. Such expectations and efforts would bring about the realization of what Hanszen 2000 sees as the future role of Hanszen Associates.
			<a name="traditions"><b>Hanszen Traditions</b></a><br>
			Neither Hanszenites nor members of Hanszen can seem to agree on where tradition fits in at Hanszen, and probably some are sorry we asked.  Discussion ranged from sweat shirts to boy scouts, from militance, to tolerance, from Fight Night, to Christmas.  Hanszen 2000 questioned whether Hanszen is satisfied with the level of tradition now, and does Hanszen prefer a low level of tradition. The inability to resolve certain questions such as whether Hanszen needs a college cheer, or other institutionalized traditions suggests a level of unsatisfaction.  On the other hand, this may reflect Hanszen's apparent attachment to it's "laid-back" atmosphere and diverse membership  ie. "Hanszen is a place where you can be yourself and you don not have to feel obliged to shout 'Team Wiess' if you don't want to." Hence Hanszen 2000 would like to see tradition as building a sense of unity within the college by getting diverse groups of people involved with the whole college.<br><br>
			While Hanszen's appeal seems to rest on its friendly familiar atmosphere, suggestions have been made for a large scale college party, like Wiess's NOD, or Lovett's Casino Party; essentially, something to replace the now obsolete Fight Night.  The hopes are that such an event would not only give college members something to look forward to, but would also contribute to a sense of unity and pride within the college.  Reviving Hanszen's Mardi Gras Night in the spring would fill the gap in the university-wide social calendar as far as big parties go.<br><br>
			Aside from specific events, tradition plays a crucial role in the day-to-day activity of Hanszen.  First of all, Hanszen remains an academic institution.  Hanszen already has an established academic tradition in its sponsorships of yearly rug lectures as well as the college test files (and some of the best, most frequent, and well attended study breaks around), Yet the college does not seem to be tapping it's resources effectively.  Hanszen has a great cross-section of associates who were chosen because of their outstanding qualities, yet most go relatively unnoticed by the college.  Increasing the number of rug lectures would not only complement the small, congenial atmosphere at Hanszen, but also would strengthen Hanszen's ties to its associates.  Also, the quality of the lectures and the amount of college participation would most likely increase even more.<br><br>
			Socially speaking and in following with the tradition of "laid-back-ness," we have observed that Hanszen tends toward the spontaneous.  Last year, for instance, Dan Smith somewhat spontaneously initiated a staff appreciation night which became a huge success.  The event was repeated this year, and will hopefully become a tradition here as well as at other colleges where they said, "Hey, Dan's idea was a pretty good one!"  Koichi Takagi turned making a statement into an art form, proposing and then accomplishing the difficult task of tying a yellow ribbon around every tree at Rice.  Although his was a personal statement of peace about the Gulf War, not only was he written up in other colleges' minutes such as Baker, but the SA granted him $80 in support.  And Hanszen has Nicki Britton to thank for a very successful spur-of-the-moment barbecue.  Not only did practically the entire college turn out that Friday, but there was much good food and fun for all.
			These three are examples of students taking the necessary initiative to action. Their example suggest a working definition of tradition: starting small, but infectious, an event that is so successful that people will want to do it every year, wanting to improve on the original each time.<br><br>
			In addition, since successful traditions usually begin with a few students, we feel that special emphasis should be placed on the freshmen right from the start.  The message should be conveyed that freshmen have four years worth of opportunity to create.  Our message to them is that they need to decide what they want Hanszen to be and then act on their decision.<br><br>
			Hanszen's self-perception of an open, friendly, tolerant college recognizes the diversity of its members.  "Traditions carved in stone" remain undesirable in addition to most institutionalized traditions because of their tendency to alienate members of the college.  Thus rather than tradition being the end goal, tradition should be step toward unity.  Unity would not mean making Hanszen a homogeneous body but rather giving Hanszenites a sense of pride in their college and increasing the quality of life at Hanszen.<br>
			1. Hanszen fall musical letting students at Hanszen know that it is, in fact one of the premier shows on campus. And, Hanszen should increase publicity.<br>
			2. Publicized college wide work days/barbecue and volleyball.<br>
			3. Find a replacement for Fight Night, ie. A community/charity oriented event. Maybe Mardi Gras  Night.<br>
			4. More emphasis on the freshmen.<br>
			5. Increased amount of rug lectures.<br><br>
			<a name="cabinet"><b>Cabinet and its Officers</b></a><br>
			Cabinet exerts an extremely large influence on life at Hanszen. It establishes policies that pertain to all facets of the college, and, based on its success and attitude toward itself and its constituents, determines to a certain degree the amount of pride and enthusiasm the students exhume toward Hanszen.  Thus, student contentment with life at Hanszen depends in part on the efficiency and tone of Cabinet.  Cabinet should be a dynamic body, eager to conduct routine business and make college improvements as quickly and easily as possible.  It is important that Hanszen Cabinet meetings maintain a balance, as other college cabinets do, between fun and business.  Cabinet meetings should be interesting and funny to attract Hanszenites to come, but only as long as it does not hamper the progress of the meeting.  The meetings, as well as the minutes, should reflect a pride in Hanszen, encouraging Hanszen members to become involved and come to Cabinet.<br><br>
			It is ultimately up to the President of the Cabinet to achieve these ideal conditions.  He sets the precedents that filter through the chain of command and affect the cabinet and, therefore, the college.  He must be able to preside over the broad scope of Cabinet activity and correct fine points to keep business running smoothly.  He must be able to sense when to change business, delegate responsibility, define other officers' roles, and act authoritatively with the help of the Parliamentarian.  Finally, he must command respect so that the other officers will follow his lead.<br><br>
			In addition to the general behavior of the President, other steps should be taken to ensure an efficient Cabinet.  An effort should be made to handle as much business as appropriate before Cabinet, as well as eliminate repetition and straying away from the subject, to save time at the meetings.  Cabinet officers should try to handle petty issues themselves rather then sending them to the sections so that the whole college may vote, and, if something is sent back, discussion should be confined to before the college's examination of the issue or after - not both.  These time-saving suggestions are, again, at the discretion of the President.<br><br>
			Although the structure of cabinet as specified in the constitution is sound, changes or definitions of specific offices besides the President also may increase the efficiency and attitude of Cabinet as a whole.  First of all, the Parliamentarian should help the President maintain order at Cabinet to keep things running smoothly.  The Treasurer should be aware of how much money the college has and to what uses that money serves at all times. The secretaries must be objective in composing the minutes; the minutes should be accurate and interesting so that people will want to read them.  Announcements at meals are import and are received well at lunchtime when there is a variety of announcers.  The differences in the roles of External and Internal Vice-President are not explicitly defined in the constitution, but the two officers should share the tedious responsibilities equally.  These designations should be made at the beginning of their terms.
			Ideally, the two should be able to work well enough together to decide on their own who will oversee which responsibilities. The President may help define their roles for them periodically if one is burdened with too much work.  The job of the socials requires taking responsibility for everything social at Hanszen, form providing kegs at weekend volleyball games to planning university-wide parties.  Specific expectations for this job should be addressed by the President.<br><br>
			In general, a concerted effort must be made by the various members of Cabinet to work together, share duties, and solve problems between themselves.  However, the President must be willing to set guidelines for the expectations of the various offices to make sure business runs smoothly.<br><br>
			<a name="improvements"><b>Physical improvements</b></a><br>
			Along the lines of short term. physical improvements, the most pressing issue is to what use can we put the B&P and old game room to.  Such suggestions for the B&P included a T.V. room or a new section kitchen.  The kitchen would be created in the back of the B&P in order to maintain all of the open floor space in the front for college activities (ie. Chug practice, talent shows).  A consensus was reached that for over the summer the space would be best utilized by keeping it as a storage place.<br><br>
			As far as the old game room several suggestions were offered: study lounge (to replace the Commons study area), weight room, bowling alley, move the laundry room there, or install a hot tub.  While the hot tub seemed highly popular, liability and actual feasibility came into question. Thus, the most plausible possibilities are to turn it into a study lounge or a weight room. The cons against the study are whether anyone will actually use it seeing as though we already have the Weenie Loft and commons loft at designated study areas.  Also with the weight room, this question of usage comes into play due to the fact we are located so close to the gym.<br><br>
			Since the games have been moved to the commons underloft, a controversy over where the rug talks will now be held was raised. The suggestion to use the Masterson room or upper loft was made. If moved up to the upper loft a request for better furniture was made to improve the atmosphere and hopefully draw more people to use it.<br><br>
			Once dealing with the loft areas, our attention was soon turned to the commons as a whole. A Hanszen alumnus, Bob Truscott, had instigated a long term design for the appearance of our commons which now has fallen by the wayside. This included putting new tables, chairs, O.C. lockers, and eventually a new floor as well as coordinating it in a blue and white color scheme (Hanszen's colors). The banner issue was again raised whereby a hope was expressed to either get nicer looking banners, or see if some relatively inexpensive way might be found to print graduating seniors names on them.  Obviously this project will take several years to accomplish, but we feel it is in the best interest of the college to set its sights on the achievement of such long term goals.  We realize that much time and money must be put into this, but hopefully there will be some individual with enough drive and dedication to kick off the project in case the ambiance committee does not rally to put this plan in action.<br><br>
			Hanszen's exterior physical appearance has improved in the quad since the winter grass has sprouted.  However, a common hope was expressed to get more and better patio furniture for the quad to encourage a more social atmosphere in order to promote more college unity.  Tables were also proposed for around the grill area by the volleyball court.  The condition of this deck, however, was a concern.  Maintenance is needed to preserve the wood, as well as maintenance is needed for the grill.  As far as other items within Hanszen, the old section sundeck is deteriorating quite fast with its splintered floor, and the new section could use some new turf.<br><br>
			Ideally Hanszen 2000 would like to see more use out of these public spaces. We feel that the use of these areas will not only increase the social atmosphere, but ultimately will serve as a building block for Hanszen unity.  We realize that technically the ambiance committee should be overseeing both the immediate short term usage of space as well as long term physical improvements.  Hanszen must also realize that sometimes, however, it is only through the initiation and motivation of one or a few dedicated Hanszenites that projects like these get done as we have seen through previous precedence which has taken this college as far as it has come today.<br><br>
			<a name="oweek"><b>Orientation Week</b></a><br>
			This week Hanszen 2000 discussed what orientation week is all about, how it has changed and changes that need to be made. Comparing the experiences of four years of freshman O-weeks, several years of advising at different colleges and coordinating at Hanszen that we have on the committee, we were able to develop what we thought were the goods and bads of Hanszen O-Week as it is now and what could be done to improve it, the advisor selection and the coordinator selection.<br><br>
			Orientation Week is a time for everyone to get to know one another and become identified with some aspect of Rice University or Hanszen College. It is the time that freshman will form their first impression of Rice and Hanszen. Because of this, it is up to the advisors and coordinators to expose them to all aspects of Rice and introduce them to college life; it's a quick view of what Rice has to offer individuals for the next four years of their life. Looking at past O-weeks and how they have changed, it seems that more and more often the emphasis has been on telling freshmen about everything at Rice instead of actively showing freshman how things are done i.e. family style dinners- now freshmen have heard of family style dinners, but they don't know how it is done. More time should be spent showing them life at college and not just telling them how it will be. Unfortunately, time is of the essence during O-weeks because the coordinators have very little time to work with due to the placement tests, academic advising, and other university activities, so there seems to be little that can be done to improve this aspect. But maybe the advisors could take a more active interesteduring O-week and immediately following O-week.<br><br>
			Advisors should be more of a friend than a counselor to the freshman. The increasingly popular attitude of that O-Week is a "fun summer camp for the advisors before getting back to school" needs to be adjusted. The advisors have been chosen to do a job not to "show-boat". This is not to say that O-Week should not be fun but that the advisors were chosen because they were genuinely interested in the freshman and not just interested in partying with their friends. A lot of this attitude can all be traced to the coordinators and their attitude about how they want O-Week run. They have the ability to affect how the advisors behave during O-Week.  The coordinators in the end set the tone.<br><br>
			The coordinator should be someone who is an independent thinker who will stand up for what he/she thinks is best, and not let the popular opinion of the college affect his/her decision. They need to be strong leaders that are willing to stand up against popular opinion. They should be creative and thoroughly excited about O-Week. They should be serious about the job and not look on O-Week as a summer camp. But they should also be personable and compatible wit lots of different types of people. Most of all, they should be dedicated to having a successful O-Week.<br><br>
			We talked about how other colleges pick their coordinators (elections, picked by a panel or the masters decide) and determined that the way Hanszen does the coordinator selection is a really good way because it is the most democratic. If too many "beautiful" people were selected then O-Week would give the freshmen the idea that Hanszen is made up of a bunch of cliques, and the only way to fit in would be to find the right clique. By selecting coordinators through a panel, you eliminate the possibility that the same type of person will be selected every year.<br><br>
			One thing we thought is that if might be a good idea for the coordinators to meet with the masters, president and resident associates and determine what tone they want to set and what general guidelines they want to follow, so that when it comes to advisor selections they are all looking for the same qualifications. If the tone is set before, then there will be no misunderstanding during O-Week about what is expected of everyone. These guidelines are not meant to restrict the creativity of the coordinators, because they definitely need their freedom, but merely to help them get things started.<br><br>
			Orientation Week is a time to get to know each other.  It's the time to get the freshmen orientated to Hanszen and to Rice. A lot of what determines their impressions is how O-Week is run and that goes back to the coordinators; therefore, one of the most important decisions about O-Week actually happens before O-Week - it's the coordinator selections. This decision is very important for the whole college and the Orientation Week.<br><br>
			<a name="ocstudents"><b>Off Campus Students</b></a><br>
			Nearly one half of the people assigned to Hanszen College choose to live off campus for a variety of reasons.  These people include Varsity athletes, fifth years, and sophomores who have been kicked off.  In keeping with our original goal of promoting unity, Hanszen 2000 discussed ways to give off campus people a common connection, both with-in themselves and with Hanszen college members as a whole.<br><br>
			A common complaint among off campus people is that they are not informed of college events such as college night, Hanszen day, and elections. They express an interest in what's going on but don't know how to get involved. We decided that the OC newsletter is a good way to easily reach the 200 off campus people.  Publishing the OC newsletter has never been required of a specific group or committee, such as the OC section reps, so it has depended on the commitment of those people.  We suggest that cabinet make this a responsibility of a willing group of people to ensure that it is accomplished every week.<br><br>
			Aside from week to week information, some of the suggestions for what the newsletter should include were; an explanation of the OC subsidy on election days and college nights, invitations to college night, where to find publications like the RPC calendar, a list of officers and section reps, and information about intramural and college sports.  It suggested that an interest survey could be included in the first newsletter to determine the interest level among OC people.  This would furnish a list to the heads of committees and team organizers who could take the initiative in calling those people interested.<br><br>
			Another suggestion about initially finding out OC people's interest in college activities was to have a beginning of the year study break.  Surveys could be passed and collected then.  This would also let the OC people know that they are part of the college and would give them an opportunity to meet other OC people.<br><br>
			The issue of sophomores that are kicked off campus deserves special attention.  It was suggested that to lessen the shock of having to move off, a information bulletin could be put together saying things like where is a good place to live, some tips about finding a good apartment, and reassurance that they are still part of Hanszen college.  In the past, groups of Hanszenites have lived in the same apartment complex and this seemed to make the OC experience easier by making them feel less isolated. We weren't sure how this could be accomplished but the issue of living in a specific place might be addressed in the info bulletin.<br><br>
			One of our goals in Hanszen 2000 was to promote a greater sense of unity among Hanszen members. We believe that OC people should be made to feel included as members of the college through an OC newsletter and other information to help keep them in touch.  The initiative to become involved has to ultimately come from the OC people themselves but we should give them every opportunity to do so.<br><br>
