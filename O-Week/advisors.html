<a href="http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~elio"><b><h2>Elio Abbondanzieri</b></a><br>
<i>Hanszen '99</i></h2><br>
Hi.  My name is Elio (you can pronounce it by saying the letters L, E, O) Abbondanzieri (consider yourself special if you can pronounce that).  I’m just your typical cartoon watching, falafel eating, bike riding, Star Wars obsessing, tunneling studying, Simpson’s quoting, minutes writing, Physics majoring, Coen Brothers adulating, Seinfeld living, Feynman reading, D.J. Shadow listening, pop-culture junkie from New York.  If that list of modifiers didn’t scare you too much (and it probably should have) feel free to come by my room (471 at the top of the tower) any time.<p><hr><p>

<b><h2>Drew Bagley</b> <br>
<i>Hanszen '98</i></h2><br>
Drew Bagley, a Hanszen senior, is known as many things to many people: a fighter, a lover, a forger of friendships and a really bad roommate. He denies all of these titles, preferring a simple "sir" or, occasionally, "dear sir."  In 1994 Drew was nominated for an Academy Award for dramatic performance in a Rice admissions interview, but was disqualified for "making everything up." In his spare time Drew performs free medical exams for injured manatees in his hometown of Tampa, Florida. Drew's future career plans include graduating, attending post-graduation parties, and then sleeping it all off. His goal for O-Week: to get to know each of you as individuals, not just statistics written on a wadded-up ball of paper in a campus trashcan.<p><hr><p>

<b><h2>Rebecca Case</b><br>
<i>Sid Rich '97</i></h2><br>
Trying to describe myself is such a daunting task even for a 
talkative person such as myself, so I had to enlist the help of a higher power - the guru on the mount called Stevie T. "Hmmm...Rebecca's obviously very fluctionary, but I doubt that many realize that her plesiomorphous qualities are what really make her unique.  In order to really experience her inner being, you should ask her to show you her prehallux, but of course that's something that only she can choose to share.  She also has an unfortunate problem with quassation."  So whatever that means...Other factoids about myself are that I am a fifth year psychology and sports medicine major from Sid Richardson College.  I played varsity volleyball here at Rice for four years and finally have a year off.  If you're ever looking for me you should start at the beach volleyball courts.<p><hr><p>

<h2><b>Seema Chandra</b><br>
<i>Hanszen '99</i></h2><br>
I spent some time trying to think of cool ways to introduce myself.  I thought about SEEMA: Smiling Energetic Enigma Musing Alliteration or She Ends Each Morning Asleep, but none of them really seemed to encompass me.  So, I’ll do this the boring way.  I’m a Floridian to the bone, but I’m getting used to Texas.  I’m a CAPP member, which means that you are allowed to come vent to me at any time about anything, and no one else will ever know.  (Pretty spiffy, huh?)  I talk at least three hundred miles a minute, and I love to make up really bad jokes and puns that no one really thinks are funny, but I keep trying.  I’m always up for some late-night procrastination; I rarely sleep, and I can’t whistle or snap my fingers.  Just remember: If there’s no happy ending, make one out of cookie dough.<p><hr><p>

<h2><b>Stewart Chang</b><br>
<i>Hanszen '98</i></h2><br>
All right, some things about me.  I'm called Stew, Stewie, Stewart, or Charlie Brown (some say there's a resemblance), any is fine. I'm a Hanszen senior biochemistry/Latin major, who hails from Dallas, TX, and loves Hanszen more than life itself.  (This fanaticism is common in Hanszenites.)  I dream of a future in research, spending all my time in the lab, munching on Cheetos for sustenance.  Enough boring stuff.  I love the simple things in life: the Sunday comics, graham crackers & milk, "Xena:Warrior Princess" and "Renegade," going to the movies, and hanging out with friends.  Your advisors might snicker about my "experimenting," but, uh, don't ask.<p><hr><p>

<b><h2>Danny Chelius</b><br>
<i>Will Rice '00</i></h2><br>
Friendly...funny...loyal...soccer...drums...romantic...ballroom dance...religious studies...trustworthy...helpful...oh, Eagle Scout...lover...not a fighter...mudfights...Bayou City Blues...English...pre-med...post-freshman...Will Rice...co-advisor...Noemie rocks my world...Paris, Texas...volleyball...Pink Floyd...David Maslanka is 'da bomb...Ryan and I can't bowl...APC...sensitive...ice-skating...computer Illiterate...puns...Oh where - Oh where did Trey's hair go?...Les Miserables...family man...theater...The Crucible...Honor Council...The Marching Owl Band...Women's Volleyball...Naomi's meet sheet picture...did I mention ROMANTIC?...Jennifer...Las Vegas...Is that 100 words yet?...I love you <p><hr><p>

<a href="http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~jcloudm"><b><h2>John Cloudman</b></a><br>
<i>Hanszen '99</i></h2><br>
Hey ya’ll... My name’s John, and I'm a tall, loud, energetic, and slightly preppy Electrical Engineer from Darien, Connecticut.  If you're a yankee too, and you're appalled that I used "ya’ll", just wait... it'll grow on you.  Anyway, I'm a diehard New York sports fan  (go Yankees!) and I'm also an EMT (so if you hurt yourself, I'll take care of you, I promise).  I like to sleep, and I'm in front of a computer a lot, but don't worry, I'm always ready and willing to have a good time... just stop by my room (you can even say hi to some of those coordinator-types).<p><hr><p>

<b><h2>Brooke Cotter</b><br>
<i>Hanszen '00</i></h2><br>
Welcome to Rice!  I’m a fast-talking, animal-cracker loving, ribbon wearing Hanszenite who can’t wait to meet ya.  If you want to dance, play soccer, eat (anything, anytime), and laugh like crazy, take a chance on me! (I’m also an ABBA freak, ten points to anyone who understands the reference!)  I love to talk and talk and talk.  So if you dare to brave a conversation with a sassy motormouth come on over!  See ya in August!<p><hr><p>

<b><h2>Mary Derr </b><br>
<i>Hanszen '00</i></h2><br>
Hey you all!  I’m a Michigan native whose academic interests are caught between chemistry and political science (which means that I am totally undecided about what I’m majoring in).  Until we meet in rainy Houston, I’ll be passing my summer days working at a science program for middle school students and taking a few classes at the university in my hometown of Kalamazoo.  I look forward to seeing you soon -- O-Week is going to be awesome!<p><hr><p>

<a href="http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~tdunn"><h2><b>Travis Dunn</b></a><br>
<i>Hanszen '98</i></h2><br>
OK, so maybe the hair does look a little goofy now, but I promise it'll be longer by O-week.  I'm one of the Bam-Bam advisors along with Kiyomi and Heather, and we're all excited about meeting you.  I'm a soccerfanatic and get my RDA of Simpson's. As a chemistry major with a passion for organic chemistry I qualify as a nerd, and I advise you to avoid the CK Beef au Jus. (check spelling on that dish, would ya')<p><hr><p>

<h2><b>Mike Eisenberg</b><br>

<a href="http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~rganske"><b><h2>Rod Ganske</b></a><br>
<i>Hanszen '00</i></h2><br>
I would tell you where I’m from and what I major in, but wouldn’t it be better if we defined people not by these things, but by something deeper, like what they look like?  So, I’m tall, dark, handsome, and after my modeling career I plan to pursue a job in global domination.  Actually, I’m just crazy Rod, and you need to take everything I say with at least one grain of salt.  But, I am serious about this being the best O-Week ever.  So hurry up and get here!<p><hr><p>

<a href="http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~efren"><h2><b>Efrén Garcia</b></a><br>
<i>Hanszen '99</i></h2><br>
MM, 20, 5' 0", 300lbs.  Mechanical Engineer.    Happy go lucky kind of guy. Enjoy eating pizza and drinking Dr. Pepper =).  Love to speak in Spanish and having chit chats.

<b><h2>Nisha Gidwani</b><br>
<i>Sid Rich '98</i></h2><br>
Hi everyone!  Hope you're enjoying your summer.  My name's Nisha and I'm a senior ChemE from Sid.  I'm also a native Texan from Sugar Land who loves to eat Mexican food, watch movies, play tennis, and go clubbing.  At Rice, if I'm not "studying" in the library you can find me chilling with friends, dancing with the South Asian society, or helping out with the RPC. I'm also a die hard Houston Rockets fan, and I love football.  I'm really excited about advising at Hanszen this year- and I can't wait to meet you.  See you <p><hr><p>

<b><h2>Laura Gill </b><br>
<i>Hanszen '98</i></h2><br>
Hello there!  I'm from Texas and a senior at Hanszen, although I will be staying a fifth year.  Having transferred here mid-semester my freshman year, I see Rice from a somewhat unique perspective, and I think it rocks!  My major is German but that's just for fun because I'm studying to go to vet school.  As you can gather from that, I love animals and everyone here at Hanszen knows it 'cause they always bring me stuff.  When I'm not playing with animals, I'm a normal, talkative, cheerful person who's pretty laid back.  I'm also a Career Services advisor and am one of the Sammy-the-Owl mascots.  I can't wait to meet ya’ll during O-Week!<p><hr><p>

<h2><b>Jen Hamilton</b> <br>
<i>Hanszen '99</i></h2><br>
I am tall.  I am a basketball player.  I am loud.  Come talk to me, I have a neat last name.<p><hr><p>

<b><h2>Heather Hardin</b><br>
<i>Wiess '99</i></h2><br>
Hi! I'm Heather, an easy-going, fun-loving, country-dancing, cheese-hating, diet-coke drinking, tone-deaf singing, gymnastics teaching, football hostessing, cheerleading, junior English and Sports Management major who loves to be involved from Buda (Austin), Texas.  I love Rice, hanging out with my friends, playing Powderpuff football and intramural tennis, working on the yearbook, going to tons of baseball, football, and hockey games, eating, shopping, and sleeping.  And I can't wait to meet a few good friends from Hanszen <p><hr><p>

<b><h2>Naomi Horowitz</b><br>
<i>Hanszen '00</i></h2><br>
Greetings!  I’m Naomi (that’s Nay-o-mi not Noh-ay-mi like some Hanszenites say!) from McLean, VA.  At Hanszen, I’m known for my 'Newcomer’s Guide' picture (I’m about 4) and an undying passion for disco.  Addictions: parenthesis (can you tell?) Word-a-Day email,   SweeTarts and the Container Store.  I’m so excited to show you what that Hanszen Rama Jama’s all about.<p><hr><p>

<b><h2>Matt Huelsman </b><br>
<i>Hanszen '98</i></h2><br>
Hi Ya’ll!!  Yes I said ya’ll, so ya’ll are just going to have to get used to it.  It is the only acceptable word to use in Texas.  Anyway, I am a senior ChemE that loves to play sports, and loves to have fun, so ya’ll need to get yourselves down here as soon as possible, so we can get this party started.<p><hr><p>

<h2><b>Karrie Johnson</b><br>
<i>Hanszen '99</i></h2><br>
Hi!  I'm Karrie and welcome to Hanszen College.  You're looking at a future lawyer majoring in Political Science & Policy Studies.  Karrie's thoughts on life:<br>
1)Country music & dancing are good for the soul. <br> 
2)One can never consume enough fried chicken, chocolate or coke. <br> 
3)Sleep is your friend.  <br>
4)Most ideas are thought of on the toilet. <br> 
5)Laughter and love are what make the world go round.  <br>
6)Backpacks are forever. <br>
7)  Orange juice can cure anything.  And last, but certainly not least <br>
8)  There is clearly a party in every Karrie...<br>
all of these will become        self-evident upon arrival.  I can't wait to meet you!<p><hr><p>

<b><h2>Matt Kanan</b><br>
<i>Hanszen '00</i></h2><br>
Hi Folks! I'm from Southern California and I'm probably enjoying a nice day at the beach or a Cubs game on WGN as you're reading this. (Yes, I do have a job this summer.)  Although the weather, and the beach, is nicer at home, I'm anxious to get back to Rice and meet all of you--I'm one of those rare people who loves being in school. I enjoy almost any subject, so it's been hard to think of a major.   I also like to run in the Houston heat, preferably NOT by myself--so come along sometime!<p><hr><p>

<b><h2>Ginger Mills</b><br>
<i>Hanszen '99</i></h2><br>
I am woman, hear me roar!!<p><hr><p>

<b><h2>Laurie Palombo</b><br>
<i>Lovett '98</i></h2><br>
Hi!  My name is Laurie Palombo from Plano, TX. (it's bigger than it sounds)!  I'm a SENIOR Chemical Engineering & Economics major from good ole Lovett College!  My favorite things include meatballs, new dresses, fun dance music, juicy stories, my roommates & friends, my family, and anything related to romance.  So if you see people dancing to "Hey Mickey" on the bed by the room window, hear the loud beat of techno music or smell the scent of homemade Italian you've just walked by Sandi (my awesome roommate) and my room on second floor Lovett.  You are going to Love Rice - NO DOUBT - I can't wait to meet you.<p><hr><p>

<b><h2>Pray Penumalli </b><br>
<i>Wiess '00</i></h2><br>
My name is Pratap (pronounced Pra-thop) but you can call me "Pray." A sophomore Biology and Policy Studies major, I came to Rice from Andover, Massachusetts.   You can usually find me lounging around Wiess College, my home at Rice.  I ran track seriously in high school, and play a lot of intramural sports now. To get to know me better, here is a list of my favorites --- number: 14; pizza topping: Canadian bacon; color: Blue; fruit: mango; activity: Hanging out with friends (or with strangers); Quote: "I'm spunky. I like my oatmeal lumpy!"  See you in the fall!<p><hr><p>

<h2><b>Sherry Phelps </b><br>
<i>Hanszen '99</i></h2><br>
Athletic, powder puff and basketball<p><hr><p>

<b><h2>Ryan Plumley </b><br>
<i>Hanszen '99</i></h2><br>
So, it's the very first day of college.  You're approached by this tall, and well, strikingly handsome stranger.  He smiles.  He introduces himself, saying, "Hi, I'm Ryan.  Welcome to the best O-Week ever!!!"  At this point you're impressed by his diction and elaborate vocabulary. You think, Hey, I'm glad I came to Rice, the people here are so articulate.  And, He must be an actor: his enunciation is really good.  And, Wow, what a remarkable sense of history he has: he must be a hard-core history major.  Well, the person you just met is, in fact, your personal guide to the ins and outs of Rice life, and he's here to make your whole experience just as good as those first few seconds.  So look for Ryan-the-Advisor during O-Week and you'll be looking for a good time.<p><hr><p>

<b><h2>Lara Reddy</b><br>
<i>Baker '98</i><br>
Hi, I'm Lara.  This is my fourth and last O-Week at Rice, but my first at your new home, Hanszen College.  I'm sure we'll have an amazing O-Week to start your Rice experience.  I'm a senior at Baker College, majoring in History, Sociology, and Policy Studies.  I'm on Baker Cabinet, the SA, and SAC.  I also work with Rice Athletics, the RPC, and Admissions.  I'm a California girl, but Rice is home.  I love smoothies, country music, and the beach at sunrise.  I can't wait to meet ya'll.  This will be a great year at Hanszen.  Go Fred <p><hr><p>

<b><h2>Adam Reiser</b><br>
<i>Jones '97</i></h2><br>
SWM, really tall.  Like, I mean tall.  Not your average NBA player.  Taller than that.  Gigantic.  Monstrous.  We're talking really, really, big.  Likes running.  Outdoors.  Camping.  Little fat dogs.  Honey Brown beer.  Red Wine.  Beautiful women to drink with.  Beautiful women period.  Watching golf on TV.  Not just Tiger, but everyone.  Can't play worth a !*@% though.  Hates talking, social interaction, etc.  Not a conversationalist.  Not even close.  Well, okay, maybe a little.  Likes weather.  Tornadoes, hurricanes, hail, etc.  Not getting hit by hail.  Just watching it.  From a safe place.  Is going storm chasing this summer.  Also going to Kenya.  To bring running shoes.  Long story.  Hopes not to get eaten.  That's not the reason to bring running shoes, however.  Nice try.  Makes sense- animals that can eat you are generally hard to outrun.  Even in running shoes.  Even Nikes.  (They don't want you to know that, though.)  Looking for interesting, fun, intelligent Rice people.  Specifically freshman.  Wants to share life experiences, late night conversations, silly O-Week games, etc.  Will bring the little fat dogs.  And the Nikes.  You bring yourself.  And a smile.  And don't get eaten before O-Week.<p><hr><p>

<h2><b>Kelley Riddle</b><br>
<i>Hanszen '00</i></h2><br>
Hi!  I’m Kelley, but you can call me Kel, Kellers, Skriddle, or whatever you want. I’m a native Houstonian (actually, I was born about 5 minutes from Rice) who presently resides in the north Houston suburbs of Spring.  Currently, I’m studying to be a Mechanical Engineer, although my future life plans include law school somewhere in there (don’t ask).  I’m CRAZY about shopping, all kinds of music, the Rockets, forest green, Party of Five, singing, Pearl Jam, chocolate-chip cookies, Coke, flowers, crying in movies, TCBY, good friends, Frapuchinos (from Starbucks), laughing, and HANSZEN!!!<p><hr><p>

<a href="http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~angelica"><b><h2>Angélica Rodriguez</b></a><br>
<i>Wiess '99</i></h2><br>
Hello!  My name is Angélica Diana Rodriguez, but my friends call me Gél (pronounced "Hell") for short.  It's a powderpuff (women's football) thing!  Well, here are some facts about ME!  I am a Wiess junior and I play on the Wiess PowderPuff team!  I have tons of energy and I love to use all of it!  Most of the time you can find me hanging out "doing homework" and the rest of the time you'll see me dancing at a party somewhere.  I love to laugh, I love to dance, and I LOVE to have fun!  I can't wait to meet you guys in the fall!  See you soon!<p><hr><p>

<b><h2>Susan Shantz</b><br>
<i>Wiess '99</i></h2><br>
A Mathematical Economics and French major, a Canadian from Colorado,  and a fanatical Wiessman.  I love to jump on the Wiess trampoline, smile from ear to ear, dance at 2:00 am to 80's tunes, eat lots of pizza (but I absolutely hate Italian food…strange, eh?), watch horror flicks with my nails dug into someone's arm, stay up and talk until all hours of the night, and try to teach boys how to two-step.  I've been here two years, and I still haven't said "ya'll".  I'm excited to meet all of you.  Have a great summer, and I'll see you in August!<p><hr><p>

<b><h2>Kristen Sharpley</b><br>
<i>Jones '00</i></h2><br>
Hey!  I'm a sophomore from Jones hailing from Sunny Los Altos, CA.  I'm a music major, studying Voice Performance and maybe even Music History.  Besides being in the operas and singing, I love working with the Baptist Student Ministries, this year as a freshman bible study leader, volunteering with Best Buddies, giving campus tours, staying involved with Campus Crusade for Christ and hanging out with friends.  I'm also a wanna-be Texan and love kicker dancing!  Yee-haw!<p><hr>

<h2><b>Daryl Shorter</b><br>
<i>Hanszen '98</i></h2><br>
SA President, loud<p><hr><p>

<h2><b>Kiyomi Troemner </b><br>
<i>Hanszen '00</i></h2><br>
Hi!  My name is Japanese in origin, and some of my friends call me Kiwi for short.  My home is in Okinawa, Japan, where my mother's side of the family resides.  My father is American, and I grew up on military bases overseas, and yes, I am a military brat.  Living in the States is a new experience for me, and I've found that I love Houston-the weather is hot and humid just like my island back home!  Being an archi, I love art and spend most of my time creating things at all hours of the night.  Advising is something I've wanted to do since my O-Week in Aug of '96, and I won't be sorry for my summer to end so I can meet the class of 2001<p><hr><p>

<b><h2>Charlie Walker </b><br>
<i>Hanszen '00</i></h2><br>
I am a more or less native Northern Californian, but my parents moved to Wyoming during my freshman year.  I’m a Mech. E. who thinks there isn’t a better use of the sunny days of Houston than playing any and all sports: soccer, football, tennis, golf, softball and sand volleyball.  I love to simply hang out and relax playing cards, shooting pool or talking.  I’m a devoted night owl who thinks lowly of those who don’t recognize the value of sleeping late.  I love fast cars, loud stereos and big trucks.<p><hr><p>

<b><h2>Christine Yeh</b> <br>
<i>Hanszen '98</i></h2><br>
Hi!  I'm a native Texan from the great suburb of Sugar Land.  Just take a look at all of the sugar packets around here and you will get a taste of home for me.  I am a fast talking, loud, people loving Asian who has a passion for country music.  I also love to run around like a chicken with my head cut off and am easily distracted by the sight, sound, or smell of food!  I don't understand a darn thing about computers but am an e-mail addict!  My addictions also extend to watching Friends and making bets that involve food!<p><hr><p>
