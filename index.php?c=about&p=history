While the college has grown substantially since then, however, the original building still stands today and is fondly known as old section.  For more information regarding the facilities, see the virtual tour.</p>		<p>Formally established in 1957 and named for Harry Clay Hanszen, Hanszen College was the third residential college to join the Rice University residential college program.  Although it was not the first college, it quickly distinguished itself in numerous regards.  For instance, Hanszen was the first to come up with a college crest -- something quickly adopted by the other residential colleges. Hanszen also became known as the "gentlemans college" and was responsible for starting the coffee shop and KTRU, Rice's radio station.</p>		<p>Although the college has evolved dramatically over the years, many things remain the same today.  The long standing rivalry between Hanszen and Wiess college continues in perpetuity.  Simple observation of the collection of jacks pulled on Wiess by Hanszenites during O-Week and Willy Week, and the distaste with which Hanszenites anti-cheer the cult-like "Team Wiess" cheer, clearly demonstrate this hostility.  And while the other colleges may argue that Hanszen struggles at Beer Bike, we simply own each and every one of them during Willy Week -- 2006's Operation Jack-Off attests to this fact (<a href="http://the.ricethresher.org/news/2006/03/31/jackscollegerivalries">Read More</a>).</p>		<p>Hanszen also continues to set the pace at Rice University.  Althea Tupper, 2006-2007 Student Association President, Stephen Rooke, 2006 Hanszen College President, and other Hanszenites in leadership positions throughout the college and university set the campus-wide tone and lead their fellow students in pursuit of greater ambitions.  Numerous contributions to the Thresher by Hanszen students attests to this fact and proves that Hanszenites, in particular, care about their lives, passions, the University and the World beyond the hedges.</p></div></div><!-- Footer --><div id="footer">	<!-- Copyright Info -->Copyright &copy;2005 Hanszen Residential College, <a href="http://www.rice.edu/">Rice University</a>.
