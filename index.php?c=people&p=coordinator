<bold>E-Mail:</bold> Joyce at Rice dot edu<br>

<p>I have worked at Rice for 8 years in two different divisions before joining the Hanszen family in January 2006.  I am very familiar with the Rice campus and know many people in the academic departments, which could be very helpful to you.</p>

<p>During your time at Hanszen you will undoubtedly hear about my family.  I have been married for 18 years and have 3 sons, ages 19, 17, and 13.  Our oldest son will be going off to college this fall.  Our family is very active in our church with my husband being the youth director.  We go to camp every summer and love spending time with teenagers and young adults.  We love watching movies, especially sci-fi.  Yes, I am a trekie!  I also love to read, crochet, and cross-stitch.</p>

<p>As the college coordinator I run the Hanszen Office.  The best thing about the office is that it is a GREAT place to take a break or just hang out!  Here it is very laid back and easy going.</p>

<p>While you are in the Hanszen Office you can pick up your mail and packages (the best are the care packages from mom and dad!), send or receive a fax, check your email, make copies, buy a stamp, get a band-aid or an aspirin, have some tea and/or some candy, and (my favorite) get hugs.</p></div></div><!-- Footer --><div id="footer">	<!-- Copyright Info -->Copyright &copy;2005 Hanszen Residential College, <a href="http://www.rice.edu/">Rice University</a>.
