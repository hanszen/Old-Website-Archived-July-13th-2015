<p>Perhaps you wonder just who these people called "Masters" are and what we do. This is our third year as Hanszen Masters.</p>
<p><bold>Wes</bold> has taught American Literature in the English Department for 37 years, and he teaches classes each semester as well as being one of Hanszen's divisional advisors. <bold>Barbara</bold>, a Rice alum, has taught English literature at the college level, and she taught four and five year olds in pre-K classes for fifteen years. All four of our sons, and one daughter-in-law, are Hanszenites, so we know the Rice and Hanszen experience from inside and out.</p>
<p>Our house is just a few steps from the Hanszen commons, and we are available whenever you need advice on matters academic or personal, or if you want to share an accomplishment, voice a concern, just like to chat, or see our dog, cat or turtles. Sometimes we are able to find an answer to a glitch in the registration procedure or suggest a class to take that truly appeals to your interests. We are ready to listen when you need to talk to a sympathetic friend. During the year you will find us at meals in the lower commons or setting up for Wednesday night Cabinet Meeting Study Breaks in the upper commons. You will visit the Hanszen Masters' House for a fajita meal, a committee or club meeting, the Hanszen Halloween Night party, or a late night "ice cream with a zillion toppings" study break (well, not really a zillion, but a lot!).</p>
<p>You will hear us cheering the Hanszen women's soccer or softball teams, see us pacing the sidelines at a freshman men's flag football game or passing out orange slices at halftime during a powder puff football game. You might also catch sight of us in the audience at your recital, at a poetry slam, or watching you perform at one of the many plays that are produced on campus every year. We cheer for you as a member of the Rice varsity football, volleyball, soccer or baseball teams, and we applaud loudly when you 
take part in one of Hanszen's famous Karaoke study breaks. Being a College Master is a way of life, and we love it.</p>
<p>We are involved in many activities and much of the fun of being at Rice and Hanszen, but what is most important to us as Masters is your success as a student. The road to your graduation may have a few bumps and even a sudden turn or two, and it is during these moments that we can most often help you work through the difficulties. The coming years will be filled with fun and challenges, with joy and sometimes sadness, but the true value of the Rice college system is that you will always have someone at Hanszen with whom you can share the highs and the lows. It is that supportive spirit that we prize most in Hanszen College. We call it <bold>"Hanszen Heart."</bold></p></div></div><!-- Footer --><div id="footer">	<!-- Copyright Info -->Copyright &copy;2005 Hanszen Residential College, <a href="http://www.rice.edu/">Rice University</a>.
