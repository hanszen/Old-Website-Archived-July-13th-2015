<h1>Old Section RA: Chris Revell</h1>
<bold>E-Mail:</bold> CRevell at Rice dot edu<br>
<p>As an RA, I will do my best to help each of you gain the most out of these next few years during your college experience.  I will be living with you, eating with you, playing intramural sports, hosting study breaks, attending Cabinet meetings, and anything else involving Hanszen life.  More importantly, however, I will always be around to talk and listen whenever I am needed even at 3 am!!  My door is always open and I hope you will include me on this journey ahead of you as I will be there for any triumph or challenge that may come up.</p>

<p>At this point, you may be wondering what I do other than an RA in my "professional life."  I am a fourth-year graduate student in the Department of Bioengineering pursuing a Ph.D here at Rice University.  My thesis work involves researching methods to regrow articular cartilage (specifically, cartilage of the knee) to aid in the treatment of osteoarthritis as well as other cartilage injuries (I will be needing help with my knees later in life thanks to sports injuries!!)</p>

<p>I have lived in Houston for three years now and have greatly enjoyed my time here (besides the occasional weather pattern).  Originally I am from a town in south Georgia (Columbus, GA) and went to college at Georgia Tech.</p>
<h1>New Section RA: Henny Haliburton</h1>
<bold>E-Mail:</bold> HBH at Rice dot edu<br>
<p>Henny Halliburton Halliburton became Hanszen’s RA officially July 1 and will move in to the campus right before O-Week, but she has been happily involved in college activities since her selection last December.</p>  

<p>She loves the outdoors and will go camping, hiking, or kayaking just about any time.  She likes all kinds of music, from Bach to Maroon 5, and the Dixie Chicks to The Platters.  She also enjoys going to see a variety of live performances:  plays, operas, concerts, etc.  Movies too--especially on Mondays at the Angelika, when you get popcorn and drinks for free and you get to use your free Metro pass to ride the train downtown. </p>    

<p>Henny is quickly coming to be known around campus as the "Software Queen" in her job as Software Licensing & Procurement Specialist in the Information Technology Department.  Her office in the Mudd Building is open to you during business hours as time permits.</p>

<p>She has been living in the US much longer than she did in her original home town, Santiago, Chile.</p>

<p>Henny is looking forward to living on campus and meeting all the new Hanszenites, so please stop by her place and introduce yourself.  She likes to go places and do things and talk about new adventures of all kinds.</p>
<p>Henny is also the mother of current Hanszenite: Danny Halliburton</p></div></div><!-- Footer --><div id="footer">	<!-- Copyright Info -->Copyright &copy;2005 Hanszen Residential College, <a href="http://www.rice.edu/">Rice University</a>.
