<p>
Hanszen sports have always been an integral part of Hanszen, in
that participation in sports unifies and glorifies the college.
</p>
<p>
It unifies the college in the sense that we encourage anyone and
everyone to get involved with sports somehow.  To further these aims, sports
equipment is available for check out from the "sports room" all day and
everyday, while the college reps work hard to publicize ongoing
sports.  Hanszen consistently turns out the largest college teams, as well
as the most entries into the IM tournaments.  For instance, our Men's Soccer
Team consists of over 25 members (we are currently in the playoffs as the
#1 team from our division), while Hanszen teams make up over 33% of the
Coed Softball and Men's Volleyball leagues.
</p>
<p>
Hanszen Sports glorifies the college in that Hanszen is almost
always represented among the top four teams in every IM and College
Sport.  So far this year, in the college realm Hanszen has finished 2nd in
Men's Football, Women's Football, and Coed Tennis, and 3rd in Coed
Racquetball, Freshman Football, and Swimming.  In the IM realm, Hanszen
teams won Indoor 3v3 Coed Soccer, Men's Soccer, and Wallyball, finished 2nd
in Men's Basketball, and 3rd in Coed Basketball and Coed Sand
Volleyball, and Hanszen teams made the playoffs for IM Coed
Softball, IM Coed Volleyball, IM Men's Volleyball, Men's College Soccer,
and Women's IM Basketbal.  Make sure you stop by and cheer them on!
