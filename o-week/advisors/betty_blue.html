All right, some things about me. I'm called Stew, Stewie,
Stewart, or Charlie Brown (some say there's a resemblance), any
is fine. I'm a Hanszen senior biochemistry/Latin major, who hails
from Dallas, TX, and loves Hanszen more than life itself. (This
fanaticism is common in Hanszenites.) I dream of a future in
research, spending all my time in the lab, munching on Cheetos
for sustenance. Enough boring stuff. I love the simple things in
life: the Sunday comics, graham crackers &amp; milk,
&quot;Xena:Warrior Princess&quot; and &quot;Renegade,&quot; going
to the movies, and hanging out with friends. Your advisors might
snicker about my &quot;experimenting,&quot; but, uh, don't ask.</p>
