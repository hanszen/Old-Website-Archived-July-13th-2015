Hello there! I'm from Texas and a senior at Hanszen, although I
will be staying a fifth year. Having transferred here
mid-semester my freshman year, I see Rice from a somewhat unique
perspective, and I think it rocks! My major is German but that's
just for fun because I'm studying to go to vet school. As you can
gather from that, I love animals and everyone here at Hanszen
knows it 'cause they always bring me stuff. When I'm not playing
with animals, I'm a normal, talkative, cheerful person who's
pretty laid back. I'm also a Career Services advisor and am one
of the Sammy-the-Owl mascots. I can't wait to meet ya&#146;ll
during O-Week!</p>

My name is Pratap (pronounced Pra-thop) but you can call me
&quot;Pray.&quot; A sophomore Biology and Policy Studies major, I
came to Rice from Andover, Massachusetts. You can usually find me
lounging around Wiess College, my home at Rice. I ran track
seriously in high school, and play a lot of intramural sports
now. To get to know me better, here is a list of my favorites ---
number: 14; pizza topping: Canadian bacon; color: Blue; fruit:
mango; activity: Hanging out with friends (or with strangers);
Quote: &quot;I'm spunky. I like my oatmeal lumpy!&quot; See you
in the fall!</p>

Once there was a green lizard named Sam. All his friends were
blue, though, which made him sad. So, he set out to make himself
blue, too. And he held his breath, and held it, and held it, and
held it. Sam turned blue and died. The moral: College is fun, be
an individual. I am Daryl Shorter.</p>
