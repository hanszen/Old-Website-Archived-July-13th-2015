OK, so maybe the hair does look a little goofy now, but I promise
it'll be longer by O-week. I'm one of the Bam-Bam advisors along
with Kiyomi and Heather, and we're all excited about meeting you.
I'm a soccer fanatic and get my RDA of Simpson's. As a chemistry
major with a passion for organic chemistry I qualify as a nerd,
and I advise you to avoid the CK Beef au Jus. (check spelling on
that dish, would ya')</p>

Hi! I'm Heather, an easy-going, fun-loving, country-dancing,
cheese-hating, diet-coke drinking, tone-deaf singing, gymnastics
teaching, football hostessing, cheerleading, junior English and
Sports Management major who loves to be involved from Buda
(Austin), Texas. I love Rice, hanging out with my friends,
playing Powderpuff football and intramural tennis, working on the
yearbook, going to tons of baseball, football, and hockey games,
eating, shopping, and sleeping. And I can't wait to meet a few
good friends from Hanszen </p>

Hi! My name is Japanese in origin, and some of my friends call me
Kiwi for short. My home is in Okinawa, Japan, where my mother's
side of the family resides. My father is American, and I grew up
on military bases overseas, and yes, I am a military brat. Living
in the States is a new experience for me, and I've found that I
love Houston-the weather is hot and humid just like my island
back home! Being an archi, I love art and spend most of my time
creating things at all hours of the night. Advising is something
I've wanted to do since my O-Week in Aug of '96, and I won't be
sorry for my summer to end so I can meet the class of 2001</p>
