Abbondanzieri</b></a><br>

<p align="center"><br>
Hi. My name is Elio (you can pronounce it by saying the letters
L, E, O) Abbondanzieri (consider yourself special if you can
pronounce that). I&#146;m just your typical cartoon watching,
falafel eating, bike riding, Star Wars obsessing, tunneling
studying, Simpson&#146;s quoting, minutes writing, Physics
majoring, Coen Brothers adulating, Seinfeld living, Feynman
reading, D.J. Shadow listening, pop-culture junkie from New York.
If that list of modifiers didn&#146;t scare you too much (and it
probably should have) feel free to come by my room (471 at the
top of the tower) any time.</p>

Trying to describe myself is such a daunting task even for a
talkative person such as myself, so I had to enlist the help of a
higher power - the guru on the mount called Stevie T.
&quot;Hmmm...Rebecca's obviously very fluctionary, but I doubt
that many realize that her plesiomorphous qualities are what
really make her unique. In order to really experience her inner
being, you should ask her to show you her prehallux, but of
course that's something that only she can choose to share. She
also has an unfortunate problem with quassation.&quot; So
whatever that means...Other factoids about myself are that I am a
fifth year psychology and sports medicine major from Sid
Richardson College. I played varsity volleyball here at Rice for
four years and finally have a year off. If you're ever looking
for me you should start at the beach volleyball courts.</p>

Hi! I'm Karrie and welcome to Hanszen College. You're looking at
a future lawyer majoring in Political Science &amp; Policy
Studies. Karrie's thoughts on life:<br>
1)Country music &amp; dancing are good for the soul. <br>
2)One can never consume enough fried chicken, chocolate or coke. <br>
3)Sleep is your friend. <br>
4)Most ideas are thought of on the toilet. <br>
5)Laughter and love are what make the world go round. <br>
6)Backpacks are forever. <br>
7) Orange juice can cure anything. And last, but certainly not
least <br>
8) There is clearly a party in every Karrie...<br>
all of these will become self-evident upon arrival. I can't wait
to meet you!</p>
