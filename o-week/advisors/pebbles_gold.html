I would tell you where I&#146;m from and what I major in, but
wouldn&#146;t it be better if we defined people not by these
things, but by something deeper, like what they look like? So,
I&#146;m tall, dark, handsome, and after my modeling career I
plan to pursue a job in global domination. Actually, I&#146;m
just crazy Rod, and you need to take everything I say with at
least one grain of salt. But, I am serious about this being the
best O-Week ever. So hurry up and get here!</p>

Hi! My name is Laurie Palombo from Plano, TX. (it's bigger than
it sounds)! I'm a SENIOR Chemical Engineering &amp; Economics
major from good ole Lovett College! My favorite things include
meatballs, new dresses, fun dance music, juicy stories, my
roommates &amp; friends, my family, and anything related to
romance. So if you see people dancing to &quot;Hey Mickey&quot;
on the bed by the room window, hear the loud beat of techno music
or smell the scent of homemade Italian you've just walked by
Sandi (my awesome roommate) and my room on second floor Lovett.
You are going to Love Rice - NO DOUBT - I can't wait to meet you.</p>

Hi! I'm a native Texan from the great suburb of Sugar Land. Just
take a look at all of the sugar packets around here and you will
get a taste of home for me. I am a fast talking, loud, people
loving Asian who has a passion for country music. I also love to
run around like a chicken with my head cut off and am easily
distracted by the sight, sound, or smell of food! I don't
understand a darn thing about computers but am an e-mail addict!
My addictions also extend to watching Friends and making bets
that involve food!</p>
