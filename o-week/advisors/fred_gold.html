Hey ya&#146;ll... My name&#146;s John, and I'm a tall, loud,
energetic, and slightly preppy Electrical Engineer from Darien,
Connecticut.&nbsp; If you're a yankee too, and you're appalled
that I used &quot;ya&#146;ll&quot;, just wait... it'll grow on
you.&nbsp; Anyway, I'm a diehard New York sports fan&nbsp; (go
Yankees!) and I'm also an EMT (so if you hurt yourself, I'll take
care of you, I promise).&nbsp; I like to sleep, and I'm in front
of a computer a lot, but don't worry, I'm always ready and
willing to have a good time... just stop by my room (you can even
say hi to some of those coordinator-types).</p>

Hey you all! I&#146;m a Michigan native whose academic interests
are caught between chemistry and political science (which means
that I am totally undecided about what I&#146;m majoring in).
Until we meet in rainy Houston, I&#146;ll be passing my summer
days working at a science program for middle school students and
taking a few classes at the university in my hometown of
Kalamazoo. I look forward to seeing you soon -- O-Week is going
to be awesome!</p>

Hi, I'm Lara. This is my fourth and last O-Week at Rice, but my
first at your new home, Hanszen College. I'm sure we'll have an
amazing O-Week to start your Rice experience. I'm a senior at
Baker College, majoring in History, Sociology, and Policy
Studies. I'm on Baker Cabinet, the SA, and SAC. I also work with
Rice Athletics, the RPC, and Admissions. I'm a California girl,
but Rice is home. I love smoothies, country music, and the beach
at sunrise. I can't wait to meet ya'll. This will be a great year
at Hanszen. Go Fred </h2>
