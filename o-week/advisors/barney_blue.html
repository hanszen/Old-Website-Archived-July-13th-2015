Greetings! I&#146;m Naomi (that&#146;s Nay-o-mi not Noh-ay-mi
like some Hanszenites say!) from McLean, VA. At Hanszen, I&#146;m
known for my 'Newcomer&#146;s Guide' picture (I&#146;m about 4)
and an undying passion for disco. Addictions: parenthesis (can
you tell?) Word-a-Day email, SweeTarts and the Container Store.
I&#146;m so excited to show you what that Hanszen Rama
Jama&#146;s all about.</p>

Hi Folks! I'm from Southern California and I'm probably enjoying
a nice day at the beach or a Cubs game on WGN as you're reading
this. (Yes, I do have a job this summer.) Although the weather,
and the beach, is nicer at home, I'm anxious to get back to Rice
and meet all of you--I'm one of those rare people who loves being
in school. I enjoy almost any subject, so it's been hard to think
of a major. I also like to run in the Houston heat, preferably
NOT by myself--so come along sometime!</p>

A Mathematical Economics and French major, a Canadian from
Colorado, and a fanatical Wiessman. I love to jump on the Wiess
trampoline, smile from ear to ear, dance at 2:00 am to 80's
tunes, eat lots of pizza (but I absolutely hate Italian
food&#133;strange, eh?), watch horror flicks with my nails dug
into someone's arm, stay up and talk until all hours of the
night, and try to teach boys how to two-step. I've been here two
years, and I still haven't said &quot;ya'll&quot;. I'm excited to
meet all of you. Have a great summer, and I'll see you in August!</p>
