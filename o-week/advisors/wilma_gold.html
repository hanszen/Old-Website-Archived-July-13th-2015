So, it's the very first day of college. You're approached by this
tall, and well, strikingly handsome stranger. He smiles. He
introduces himself, saying, &quot;Hi, I'm Ryan. Welcome to the
best O-Week ever!!!&quot; At this point you're impressed by his
diction and elaborate vocabulary. You think, Hey, I'm glad I came
to Rice, the people here are so articulate. And, He must be an
actor: his enunciation is really good. And, Wow, what a
remarkable sense of history he has: he must be a hard-core
history major. Well, the person you just met is, in fact, your
personal guide to the ins and outs of Rice life, and he's here to
make your whole experience just as good as those first few
seconds. So look for Ryan-the-Advisor during O-Week and you'll be
looking for a good time.</p>

Hi! I&#146;m Kelley, but you can call me Kel, Kellers, Skriddle,
or whatever you want. I&#146;m a native Houstonian (actually, I
was born about 5 minutes from Rice) who presently resides in the
north Houston suburbs of Spring. Currently, I&#146;m studying to
be a Mechanical Engineer, although my future life plans include
law school somewhere in there (don&#146;t ask). I&#146;m CRAZY
about shopping, all kinds of music, the Rockets, forest green,
Party of Five, singing, Pearl Jam, chocolate-chip cookies, Coke,
flowers, crying in movies, TCBY, good friends, Frapuchinos (from
Starbucks), laughing, and HANSZEN!!!</p>

Hello! My name is Angélica Diana Rodriguez, but my friends call
me Gél (pronounced &quot;Hell&quot;) for short. It's a
powderpuff (women's football) thing! Well, here are some facts
about ME! I am a Wiess junior and I play on the Wiess PowderPuff
team! I have tons of energy and I love to use all of it! Most of
the time you can find me hanging out &quot;doing homework&quot;
and the rest of the time you'll see me dancing at a party
somewhere. I love to laugh, I love to dance, and I LOVE to have
fun! I can't wait to meet you guys in the fall! See you soon!</p>
