<b>ginger</b> \ 'jin-jer \ n. 1: a pungent aromatic rhizome that
is used as a spice and sometimes medicinally 2: any of the
idiosyncratic genus tresor hanszenitus with a reddish tint and a
big blue EMT bag. Usually hailing from the West Texas region.<br>
Well, I tend to fit the second definition most of the time, but
there are those days... :^)</p>

SWM, really tall. Like, I mean tall. Not your average NBA player.
Taller than that. Gigantic. Monstrous. We're talking really,
really, big. Likes running. Outdoors. Camping. Little fat dogs.
Honey Brown beer. Red Wine. Beautiful women to drink with.
Beautiful women period. Watching golf on TV. Not just Tiger, but
everyone. Can't play worth a !*@% though. Hates talking, social
interaction, etc. Not a conversationalist. Not even close. Well,
okay, maybe a little. Likes weather. Tornadoes, hurricanes, hail,
etc. Not getting hit by hail. Just watching it. From a safe
place. Is going storm chasing this summer. Also going to Kenya.
To bring running shoes. Long story. Hopes not to get eaten.
That's not the reason to bring running shoes, however. Nice try.
Makes sense- animals that can eat you are generally hard to
outrun. Even in running shoes. Even Nikes. (They don't want you
to know that, though.) Looking for interesting, fun, intelligent
Rice people. Specifically freshman. Wants to share life
experiences, late night conversations, silly O-Week games, etc.
Will bring the little fat dogs. And the Nikes. You bring
yourself. And a smile. And don't get eaten before O-Week.</p>

I am a more or less native Northern Californian, but my parents
moved to Wyoming during my freshman year. I&#146;m a Mech. E. who
thinks there isn&#146;t a better use of the sunny days of Houston
than playing any and all sports: soccer, football, tennis, golf,
softball and sand volleyball. I love to simply hang out and relax
playing cards, shooting pool or talking. I&#146;m a devoted night
owl who thinks lowly of those who don&#146;t recognize the value
of sleeping late. I love fast cars, loud stereos and big trucks.</p>
