I spent some time trying to think of cool ways to introduce
myself. I thought about SEEMA: Smiling Energetic Enigma Musing
Alliteration or She Ends Each Morning Asleep, but none of them
really seemed to encompass me. So, I&#146;ll do this the boring
way. I&#146;m a Floridian to the bone, but I&#146;m getting used
to Texas. I&#146;m a CAPP member, which means that you are
allowed to come vent to me at any time about anything, and no one
else will ever know. (Pretty spiffy, huh?) I talk at least three
hundred miles a minute, and I love to make up really bad jokes
and puns that no one really thinks are funny, but I keep trying.
I&#146;m always up for some late-night procrastination; I rarely
sleep, and I can&#146;t whistle or snap my fingers. Just
remember: If there&#146;s no happy ending, make one out of cookie
dough.</p>

Hi everyone! Hope you're enjoying your summer. My name's Nisha
and I'm a senior ChemE from Sid. I'm also a native Texan from
Sugar Land who loves to eat Mexican food, watch movies, play
tennis, and go clubbing. At Rice, if I'm not &quot;studying&quot;
in the library you can find me chilling with friends, dancing
with the South Asian society, or helping out with the RPC. I'm
also a die hard Houston Rockets fan, and I love football. I'm
really excited about advising at Hanszen this year- and I can't
wait to meet you. See you </p>
