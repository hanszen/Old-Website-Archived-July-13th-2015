<h2 align="center"><b>Drew Bagley</b> <br>
<i>Hanszen '98</i></h2>

<p align="center"><br>
Drew Bagley, a Hanszen senior, is known as many things to many
people: a fighter, a lover, a forger of friendships and a really
bad roommate. He denies all of these titles, preferring a simple
&quot;sir&quot; or, occasionally, &quot;dear sir.&quot; In 1994
Drew was nominated for an Academy Award for dramatic performance
in a Rice admissions interview, but was disqualified for
&quot;making everything up.&quot; In his spare time Drew performs
free medical exams for injured manatees in his hometown of Tampa,
Florida. Drew's future career plans include graduating, attending
post-graduation parties, and then sleeping it all off. His goal
for O-Week: to get to know each of you as individuals, not just
statistics written on a wadded-up ball of paper in a campus
trashcan.</p>

Welcome to Rice! I&#146;m a fast-talking, animal-cracker loving,
ribbon wearing Hanszenite who can&#146;t wait to meet ya. If you
want to dance, play soccer, eat (anything, anytime), and laugh
like crazy, take a chance on me! (I&#146;m also an ABBA freak,
ten points to anyone who understands the reference!) I love to
talk and talk and talk. So if you dare to brave a conversation
with a sassy motormouth come on over! See ya in August!</p>

Hey! I'm a sophomore from Jones hailing from Sunny Los Altos, CA.
I'm a music major, studying Voice Performance and maybe even
Music History. Besides being in the operas and singing, I love
working with the Baptist Student Ministries, this year as a
freshman bible study leader, volunteering with Best Buddies,
giving campus tours, staying involved with Campus Crusade for
Christ and hanging out with friends. I'm also a wanna-be Texan
and love kicker dancing! Yee-haw!</p>
