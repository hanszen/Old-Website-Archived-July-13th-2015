<p align="center"><font size="2">Hey there brothers and sisters!
I'm a junior mechanical engineering major &lt;mek - ee&gt; from
the great megalopolis of Greenville, Alabama... the state that's
first in the alphabet and last in adult literacy. I'm here to
make sure that your transition to Rice is as smooth as a baby's
bare bottom, so with that in mind, here are a few tips to help
you out over the next four or five years:</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The Allman Brothers Band is the greatest thing
that ever happened to music. Always mind your Ps &amp; Qs. John
Belushi is the funniest man to ever live... John Cusack and Mike
Myers are the funniest men alive. Going to bed before 3 AM is bad
for your health. If it tastes good, it must be good for you. A
letter from a friend is better than a paycheck anyday. Black
Stingray convertibles from the 70s are the greatest cars ever
made. Never lie. Elvis is alive, and he works at the Burger King
on the corner of Main and Holcombe... he gives me free
cheeseburgers. No one ever graduates from college and says,
&quot;I wish I had spent more time studying.&quot; Watch reruns
of <i>The Wonder Years</i>. Wood pencils are better than
mechanical ones. You should always eat barbecue on the Fourth of
July. I am not Tiger Woods. You haven't lived until you've craved
IHOP pancakes at 4 AM... and then gone with your roommate because
he has the same craving... and then seen ten more Rice students
there. Parties aren't the only way to have fun. The Mighty
Morphin Power Rangers wish they were as cool as the Transformers.
Michael Jordan isn't worth a thousand public school teachers.
Goonies never say die. It's fun to play musical instruments even
if you don't know how. Be sure to spend some quality time with
your toilet. Every trip you take, short or long, should have a
story to go with it. Say &quot;yes, ma'am&quot; and &quot;yes,
sir.&quot; HFH! &quot;Big wheels keep on turnin', carry me home
to see my kin...&quot;</font></p>

<p align="center"><em>Hanszen '98</em></p>

<p><font size="2">Hey ya'll! I'm a senior from Belleaire Bluffs,
Florida, but I was born in France. I'm involved in many
activities here at Rice including what some people like to call
&quot;majors&quot;. I am so excited about FRED, WILMA &amp;
DINO-Week, that I asked Dave and Trey to write the rest ofmy
blurb to the tune of The Flintstones Theme Song. Please sing
along&#133;.</font></p>

<p><font size="2"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>Noémie, meet No - Amy, </i></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>She's a Music, Sports Med,
French major.</i></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>From the, State of Sunshine,</i></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>She wants you to come and
hang with her.</i></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>Let's cheer, with Noémie at
the game;</i></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>I hope, you don't think this
song is lame.</i></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>When you're, with Noémie,</i></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>See a Rice U. SA meeting,</i></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>A woman leading,</i></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>She's the coolest thing!!</i></font></p>

Murgatroyd</a> - <a href="mailto:dmurga@rice.edu">dmurga@rice.edu</a></p>

<p align="center"><em>Hanszen '99</em></p>

<p><font size="2">It wasn't Fred Flintstone, but his fellow
Hanna-Barbera character Snaggle Puss who said &quot;Heavens to
Murgatroyd.&quot; Well, congratulations, you've found the person
he was talking about! </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Born at an early age one David Keith Murgatroyd
(you can call me Dave), I spent my formative years in the suburbs
of Chicago, but soon (twelve years later) found my way to
Bedford, Texas, between Fort Worth and Dallas, where I remained
until coming to Rice. Along the way, I developed an affinity for
Computers and Applied Math, along with most other branches of
knowledge. As a result, I am majoring in Computer Science and
Computational and Applied Mathematics here at Rice, now entering
my third year. I rarely, however, let my academics get in the way
of why we're really here: to have fun! (parents, read: to learn!)
This usually occurs while I'm spending time with friends, be they
hanging out at Hanszen, serving on Baptist Student Ministry
Coordinating Council, leading tours, skiing, traveling, playing
chess, serving on Hanszen and University Committees, or
collecting US Presidential Memorabilia (yes, really).</font></p>
