Their duties are to be informed of and to advise the College as a whole concerning all matters. Although the University has granted the Masters ultimate authority in the College, they should confine their direct activity in the sphere of College government to only the most extraordinary situations. In the face of inaction or vacillation by the Cabinet on an important issue, the Masters may be forced, by default, to govern. Above all, the Masters should promote College government and decision-making by the students and their elected representatives, and strive to accept their dictate as College policy.</p>
   <p>2. The Masters shall advise the President of the University regarding their choice of Resident Associates.</p>
   <p>3. In the event of the Masters&rsquo; disapproval of a Cabinet measure, the Cabinet may, at its discretion, put the matter before the College as a whole in the form of a referendum. The results of the referendum will be presented to the Masters for their consideration. </p>

   <p>1. Non-resident Associates shall be invited by the Masters and the College to further the aims of the College. They shall upon invitation act in an advisory capacity to the College.</p>
   <p>2. The procedure for association shall be as follows:</p>
   <p>a. Alumni, University, and Community Associates may be suggested by any College member and formally nominated by the Associates Committee. The Cabinet may then invite the nominee to serve as an Alumni, University or Community Associate for a term of two (2) years. Alumni Associates are alumni of Hanszen residing in the Houston area who wish to remain formally affiliated with the College. University Associates are those Rice University staff members who can contribute to Hanszen in other than a faculty counselor role. Community Associates are those Houstonians whose formal relation with the College would be of general benefit.</p>
   <p>b. In the spring before their terms expire, all Alumni, University, and Community Associates who have, in the opinion of the Cabinet and at the recommendation of the Associates Committee, participated actively with Hanszen College will be invited to renew their association for another term. There is no limit to the number of terms an Alumni, University, or Community Associate may serve.</p>
